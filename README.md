# OldSkoolDoom

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

This project was built using Gamplay abilities to help people understand how to use gameplay abilities. 
At this time the game is not replicated across network connections but you can still get a decent understanding about 
setting up the basics for GAS then how to implement them.
